Coursera Course Computational Neuroscience,  lecture 7.3 Sparse Coding and Predictive Coding

How to use:
```
 >octave
 >cd <dir>
 >network
```

Issues:
+ It is not clear what this algorithm is doing
+ The learning capability of this algorithm is not clear
+ The effect of the sparseness constraint is not clear
+ The neurons are modelled as one single system with multiple outputs, the neurons seem to share each others hidden state 


Typical results:
